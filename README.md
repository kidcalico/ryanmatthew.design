# RyanMatthew.Design Portfolio Website Development

This is my own personal portfolio website. I am moving from an older,
quirkier version to a more streamlined and updated version, while I
move my more experimental stuff over to my other [website](https://kidcali.co/).
So far I've added a dark mode toggle, which broke some other stuff, but
I plan on changing a lot more about the functionality and general 
design.
